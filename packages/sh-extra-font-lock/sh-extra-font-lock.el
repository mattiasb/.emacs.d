;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides syntax highlighting of variables inside strings for
;; `sh-mode'.
;;
;; Written by Anders Lindgren and packaged up (including some docstring and
;; naming fixes) by Mattias Bengtsson.
;;
;; To activate this just add the following to your `init.el':
;; (add-hook 'sh-mode-hook 'sh-extra-font-lock-activate)

;;; Note:

;;; Code:

(defun sh-extra-font-lock--is-in-double-quoted-string ()
  "Non-nil if point in inside a double-quoted string."
  (let ((state (syntax-ppss)))
    (eq (nth 3 state) ?\")))

(defun sh-extra-font-lock--match-var-in-double-quoted-string (limit)
  "Search for variables in double-quoted strings bounded by LIMIT."
  (let (res)
    (while
        (and (setq res
                   (re-search-forward
                    "\\$\\({#?\\)?\\([[:alpha:]_][[:alnum:]_]*\\|[-#?@!]\\)"
                    limit t))
             (not (sh-extra-font-lock--is-in-double-quoted-string))))
    res))

(defvar sh-extra-font-lock--keywords
  '((sh-extra-font-lock--match-var-in-double-quoted-string
     (2 font-lock-variable-name-face prepend))))
